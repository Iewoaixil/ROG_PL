## Introduction
The source code and models for our paper ROG_PL: Robust Open-Set Graph Learning via Region-Based Prototype Learning
## Framework

## Installation
Before to execute ROG_PL, it is necessary to install the following packages:

* torch
* torch_geometric
* networkx
* matplotlib
* scipy
* numpy
* sklearn
* pyparsing
* faiss-gpu

## Overall Structure

The project is organised as follows:

* `datasets/`contains the necessary dataset files;
* `idx/` contains the noisy dataset index;
* `config/` contains the necessary dataset config;
* `utils/`contains the necessary processing subroutines;
* `Results/`save run results.
